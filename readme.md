## Using this Repository

`Wav2Vec2` model from this repository can be installed using the `pip` command:

```shell
# this will install the wav2vec2 package
pip3 install git+https://github.com/vasudevgupta7/gsoc-wav2vec2@main
```

You can use the fine-tuned checkpoints (from ü§óHub) like this: 

```python
from wav2vec2 import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, Wav2Vec2Config

config = Wav2Vec2Config()
model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC(config)
# now use this model like any other TF model

# incase you are interested in already trained model, use `.from_pretrained` method
model_id = "finetuned-wav2vec2-960h"
model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained(model_id)
```

Additionally, you can use the `SavedModel` from TFHub like this:

```python
import tensorflow_hub as hub

model_url = "https://tfhub.dev/vasudevgupta7/wav2vec2-960h/1"
model = hub.KerasLayer(model_url)

# use this `model`, just like any other TF SavedModel
```

Please checkout the notebooks referred to in this repository for more information on how to use the `Wav2Vec2` model.

## Reproducing this project

### Setting Up

```shell
# install & setup TensorFlow first
pip3 install tensorflow

# install other requirements of this project using the following command:
pip3 install -qr requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev

# switch to code directory for further steps
cd src
```

For using TPUs, it's important to store model weights and datasets in the GCS bucket so that TPU can access them directly from there. Hence we will create 2 GCS buckets - one for checkpointing and the other for storing LibriSpeech tfrecords.

```shell
# these bucket names will be required to run the training script later
export DATA_BUCKET_NAME="gsoc-librispeech-us"
export CKPT_BUCKET_NAME="gsoc-checkpoints-us"

# create GCS buckets
gsutil mb gs://${DATA_BUCKET_NAME}
gsutil mb gs://${CKPT_BUCKET_NAME}
```

### Preparing dataset

Now we will download the LibriSpeech dataset from the official website & convert them into tfrecords using [`make_tfrecords.py`](src/make_tfrecords.py). Finally, we will export all the tfrecords to the GCS bucket.

```shell
# possible values are `dev-clean`, `train-clean-100`, `train-clean-360`, `train-other-500`, `test-clean`
# you will have to follow same steps for all the configurations (specified above).
export DATA_SPLIT=dev-clean

wget https://www.openslr.org/resources/12/${DATA_SPLIT}.tar.gz
tar -xf ${DATA_SPLIT}.tar.gz

python3 make_tfrecords.py --data_dir LibriSpeech/${DATA_SPLIT} -d ${DATA_SPLIT} -n 50

# transfer tfrecords to GCS bucket
gsutil cp -r ${DATA_SPLIT} gs://<DATA_BUCKET_NAME>/${DATA_SPLIT}
```

Now your GCS bucket (`DATA_BUCKET_NAME`) should look like this:

    .
    |- ${DATA_SPLIT}
        |- ${DATA_SPLIT}-0.tfrecord
        |- ${DATA_SPLIT}-1.tfrecord
        .
        .

Follow the above steps for all other data splits. You just need to change the `DATA_SPLIT` environment variable.

### Model training

Now since everything is installed and GCS buckets are configured, we just need to run one command to initiate training.

Note: Following commands assumes that you have exported `DATA_BUCKET_NAME` & `CKPT_BUCKET_NAME` environment variables already.

The following command will fine-tune the wav2vec2 model on single/multiple GPUs or Colab/Kaggle TPUs:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

For training on Cloud TPUs, run the following command:

```shell
# export `TPU_NAME` environment variable first
# this flag will ensure that your VM connects to the specified TPUs & TPUs become visible to TensorFlow
TPU_NAME=<tpu-name> python3 main.py
```

## Running Conversion script

Original PyTorch checkpoints (from Facebook) can be converted using the conversion script available in this repository.

```shell
python3 convert_torch_to_tf.py \
--hf_model_id facebook/wav2vec2-base \ # HuggingFace Hub ID of the model you want to convert
--with_lm_head # Whether to use `Wav2Vec2ForCTC` or `Wav2Vec2Model` from this repository
```

## Running tests

```shell
# first install `torch` & `transformers`
pip3 install torch transformers

# run this from the root of this repository
pytest -sv tests
```
